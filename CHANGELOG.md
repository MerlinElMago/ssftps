`24 MAR 2020`
  Fixed a missing newline and completed author information.

`25 MAR 2020`
  Added Release
  Added Install section to README
  Fixed the behaviour where the log text would be added at the cursor position and not at the end
  Fixed (hopefully) a bug where some debug messages would cause the main window to crash. Now the system is more resilient but drops *some* log messages in favour of not closing.
  TODO: Have a look into the logging system. Still doesn't seem to be perfect.

  Fixed an issue which would not allow the user to get read/write privileges.
